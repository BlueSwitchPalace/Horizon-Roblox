### INSTALLATION:
Put the BloodEngine module wherever you want, preferably in ReplicatedStorage
The assets folder must be put in ReplicatedStorage, if you wish to put anywhere else
make sure you change the path to it in the BloodEngine module to avoid errors
	
You can replace the sounds with whatever you want and add whatever you need to add.
If you can't find any good sounds, I have put a folder for it on the devforum post for you to download.
